Bitter Than Your Mama is heavily hopped double IPA with rich malt base. The bronze color and nutty flavor is achieved by adding a bit of chocolate malt. Bitterness and aroma comes from the use of Citra, Mosaic and Ekuanot hops in every step of the brewing, starting from the boil and all the way through the dry hopping.
